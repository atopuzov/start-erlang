# How I Start: Erlang

My implementation of (basically copying code from) Fred Hebert's
[How I Start: Erlang](http://www.howistart.org/posts/erlang/1)
tutorial project.

The tests are failing to run properly, but I get the same output
when using Fred's [code](https://github.com/ferd/howistart-erlang1-code)
as well, so perhaps it is caused by some version dependency.
